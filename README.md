# Webp to jpg

## Disclaimer
This is a quick hack I've created for a personal use case. It probably sucks in a lot of ways, but works for me. Handle with care :)

## Setup
Make sure you have the Pillow-library (see `requirements.txt`) installed.

## Usage
Place all `*.webp`-files in a folder that sits right next to the directory containing this script. Then, replace the `target_dir` in the script with the foldername that contains your `*.webp`-files and run `python img_convert.py`. (Given that no errors occured, you can sort by file-kind and remove all the `*.webp`-files.)
