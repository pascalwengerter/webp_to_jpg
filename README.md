# Webp to PNG

## Disclaimer
This is a quick hack I've created for a personal use case. It probably sucks in a lot of ways, but works for me. Handle with care :)

## Setup
Run `go mod tidy`.

## Usage
Place `.webp` images in `./src/` and run

```
go run .
```
to convert them to `.png` files in the `./output/` directory.
